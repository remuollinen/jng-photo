# Photographer website (first draft)

Made with React.

This website acts as a portfolio website for a photographer based in Helsinki, Finland.

## Technologies used and what I learned building this website (more to come)

- React components, state, props
- Dynamic styling for responsive navigation bar / menu
- React Router
- Netlify form handling (no need to think about server-side form handling)
