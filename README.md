# Photographer website (version 1)

Made with React.

This website acts as a portfolio website for a photographer based in Helsinki, Finland.

## Technologies used and what I learned building this website (more to come)

- React components, state, props
- Dynamic styling for responsive navigation bar / menu
- React Router
- Netlify form handling
- Image carousel component with react-slick library
